1. Which is faster?
	
	A. The Algorithm 1 is faster.
	B. It's not guaranteed which algorithm is faster. Because both of the algorithms have lower bound, e.g. Algorithm 1 has best case Omega(N), Algorithm 2 has Omega(N^2).

	C. Same situation as B, but Upper bound (worst case).

	D. Algorithm 2 is faster than Algorithm 1. Because Algorithm 1 has tight bound Theta(N^2), but Algorithm 2 has Upper bound (worst case) O(logN).

	E. Not guaranteed.
